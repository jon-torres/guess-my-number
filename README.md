This is a single page application for demonstrating some vanilla JS and DOM Manipulation skills.

The confetti animation was provided by Dogramming. I made some refactoring on his code in order to make it more "modern".
The HTML/CSS was mostly stylized by Jonas Schmedtmann as this project intention was to train how to manipulate the DOM.
